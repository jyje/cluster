# Git Commit Policy

When writing or modifying commit messages, AI must intelligently apply the following rules.

## Format
```
<gitmoji> <type>(<domain>): <title>

<description>

Co-Authored-By: Cursor <cursor@cursor.sh>
```

## Gitmoji Usage

Gitmoji mappings follow the gitmodi standard:

- **🔧** `chore`: Routine maintenance tasks, supplementary work, or minor corrections without intentional functional changes
- **🛠️** `fix`: Intentional functional configuration changes or feature adjustments
- **✨** `feat`: Introduce new features
- **✏️** `typo`: Fix a typo
- **🐛** `bug`: Fix a bug
- **⬆️** `dep`: Upgrade dependencies
- **🔐** `security`: Add or update secrets
- **🗑️** `remove`: Deprecate code that needs to be cleaned up
- **♻️** `refactor`: Refactor code
- **📝** `docs`: Add or update documentation
- **🎨** `style`: Improve structure / format of the code
- **⚡** `perf`: Improve performance
- **✅** `test`: Add, update, or pass tests
- **🔨** `build`: Add or update development scripts

> Reference: [gitmoji.dev](https://gitmoji.dev/) - An emoji guide for your commit messages

## Type and Domain
- **Type**: `feat`, `fix`, `bug`, `typo`, `refactor`, `dep`, `security`, `remove`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `perf`, `test`, `build`
- **Domain**: Component name in parentheses, lowercase, kebab-case if needed (e.g., `(nfs)`, `(open-webui)`, `(milvus)`, `(argo-cd)`)

## Title & Description
- **Language**: Always English
- **Style**: Concise, imperative mood, start with lowercase after type
- **Description**: Optional, explain "why" or provide context

## Co-Authored-By
Always include: `Co-Authored-By: Cursor <cursor@cursor.sh>`

## Intelligence Selection
- This rule is activated only when executing `git commit` commands or when commit message writing is needed.
- Ignore this rule during simple code modifications and focus on the task at hand.
